    <p>Journal Entry 4
    <p>Name: Nicklaus Spooner</p>
    <p>Journal: J1013</p>
    <p>Date: Oct-5-2022</p>

    <p>I received assistance from: Mina Soliman</p>
    <p>I assisted:</p>

    <h2>Section 1:</h2>
    <h3>1.1: Why is one of the symbols used for exclusive disjunction "=/"?</h3>
    <p>It's the opposite of disjunction, so its showing the difference between it.</p>
    <h3>1.2: Why is the formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table related only to the number of inputs, and why is the formula 2^n?</h3>
    <p>2 to the power of the amount of inputs is equal to the amount of rows in the table.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "Big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned how to do Boolean Algebra and DeMorgan's laws.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>None.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>Make the symbols more different.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>It made binary a little more confusing but not by much.</p>
