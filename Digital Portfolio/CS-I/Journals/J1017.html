    <h2>Section 1:</h2>
    <h3>1.1: What table do you recognize that produces the output of the Carry column?</h3>
	<p>AND table.</p>
	<h3>1.2: What table do you recognize that produces the output of the Sum column?</h3>
	<p>XOR table.</p>

	<h2>Section 2:</h2>
	<h3>2.1: What do you notice about the relationsihp between the first-half (top four rows) of the full-adder compared to all of the rows of the half-adder?</h3>
	<p>They have the same output.</p>
	<h3>2.2: Why is this true?</h3>
	<p>They are both AND tables.</p>

	<h2>Section 3:</h2>
	<h3>3.1: Why does the least significant bit position use a half-adder rather than a full-adder?</h3>
	<p>The least significant bit has no carries.</p>
	<h3>3.2: Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bits in numbers A and B. Will the correct output from S be available instantaneously? If not, why not?</h3>
	<p>It won't. It takes time to commit carries.</p>
	<h3>3.3: Assume that we have a standard (non-scientific calculator) capable of adding two 16-bit words. Two numbers, A and B, are added together. After the addition, it is noted that C15 is high. What can we infer? What is this state commonly called?</h3>
	<p>The number must be above 65000, it's called the 16-bit integer limit.</p>

	
	<h2>What did I learn? What is the "Big Idea"?</h2>
	<p>I learned how complicated binary adders are.</p>

	<h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
	<p>I struggled to understand how the outputs were different.</p>

	<h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
	<p>Better explain the seperate outputs.</p>

	<h2>Free Reflection:</h2>
	<p>I can now use full and half adders.</p>
