    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "Big Idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned how to combine different gates to create new ones. The Big Idea is that these logic gates are used to make decisions.

      <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I found the program very difficult to learn at first.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>A tutorial on the simulator would be helpful.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection:</h2>
    <p>I now know how to use logic gates to form different decision possibilities and outcomes.</p>
