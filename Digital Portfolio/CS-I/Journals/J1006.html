    <h2>Section 1:</h2>
    <h3>1.1: What is git communicating to you?</h3>
    <p>That we are in the master branch.</p>
    <h3>1.2: What do you see that is common between this git log command and the previous git commit?</h3>
    <p>They show the same serial #, location, and description.</p>
    <h3>1.3: Git log is quite literally logs of previous git commits.</h3>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Section 2:</h2>
    <h3>2.1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?</h3>
    <p>They're both displayed red meaning they are uncommitted changes.</p>
    <h3>2.2: Are they both displayed in the same section? If not, why not?</h3>
    <p>No, file2.txt is new and untracked, while file1.txt is already tracked.</p>
    
    <h2>Section 3:</h2>
    <h3>3.1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?</h3>
    <p>They're now green meaning they are committed changes.</p>
    <h3>3.2: Compare and contrast the manner in which the two files are displayed.</h3>
    <p>file1.txt is marked "modified" while file2 is marked as a new file, while both are tracked in the same section.</p>

    <h2>Section 4:</h2>
    <h3>4.1: How many files are listed as having been changed?</h3>
    <p>Both.</p>
    <h3>4.2: What are the specific differences listed for each file? In what color is the difference displayed?</h3>
    <p>file1.txt says "This is a new line." while file2.txt says "This is a new line in a new file.", while both are green</p>
    
    <h2>Section 5:</h2>
    <h3>5.1: What does git tell you has changed? Why?</h3>
    <p>It says nothing because I've already done that.</p1>

      <h2>What did I learn? What is the "Big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned how to effectively use git.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I had no problems.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>I would rather use notepad or other editors, I feel like emacs is too complicated for beginners.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>Git is easier to learn how to use than I thought.</p>
