    <h2>Section 1:</h2>
    <h3>1.1: Name at least two other services that you personally use which are implemented using a Client/Server Model:</h3>
    <p>Youtube and Canvas.</p>

    <h2>Section 2:</h2>
    <h3>2.1: It appears that both jack Williams and John Williams can have a directory of the same name. Do you think the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important? Why?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Eventually, any understandable directory name would be taken by someone else.</p>

    <h2>Section 3:</h2>
    <h3>3.1: Why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to represent it?</h3>
    <p>It's important.</p>

    <h2>Section 4:</h2>
    <h3>4.1: Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this useful?</h3>
    <p>Yes, it changed to a differnet directory called Merlin, its useful for organization and grouping of files.</p>

    <h2>Section 5:</h2>
    <h3>5.1: What happens each time you press the up arrow key?</h3>
    <p>The command I'm typing goes back to the last command I entered.</p>
    <h3>5.2: What happens each time you press the down arrow key?</h3>
    <p>My last used commands gets closer to the latest command entered by 1.</p>

    <h2>Section 6:</h2>
    <h3>6.1: Was "Hello, World!" printed to the screen as before? If not, why not? What do you think happened to the text?</h3>
    <p>No, the command was instead put into the "out.txt" file.

      <h2>Section 7:</h2>
      <h3>7.1: How does the ls command differ from the tree command?</h3>
    <p>The tree command shows an orgnaized list of all files, and the files below them, while ls lists only the files in your current directory, not the ones under them.</p>
    <h3>7.2: How do you choose to use one over the other?</h3>
    <p>You use tree when you need to see which files are in which directories, while you use ls to list the files in your current directory.

      <h2>Section 8:</h2>
      <h3>8.1: What do you think the argument to sleep specifies?</h3>
    <p>It tells the terminal to pause for a specified amount of seconds.</p>
    <h3>8.2: Are you able to prove your hypothesis? How?</h3>
    <p>Yes, the number is equal to the amount of seconds it pauses for.</p>

    <h2>Section 9:</h2>
    <h3>9.1: How is the behavior different from what you expected?</h3>
    <p>It didn't pause my terminal from using commands.</p>
    <h3>9.2: What do you think it means to run a job in the background?</h3>
    <p>It will not affect the foreground of your terminal.</p>
    <h3>9.3: What do you think the number displayed in brackets specifies?</h3>
    <p>The job number.</p>

    <h2>Section 10:</h2>
    <h3>10.1: What do you observe as you execute the jobs command?</h3>
    <p>All running jobs show, and the timer of jobs goes down.</p>
    <h3>10.2: How do you explain your observations?</h3>
    <p>The jobs command shows all running jobs and the duration of time left.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "Big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned how to use jobs and directories.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I had no problems.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>Less questions, this was an extremely long wiki and had way too many questions.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>Jobs was a little complicated but I feel like I easily got the hang of the wiki subject.</p>
